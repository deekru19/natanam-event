# Natanam Event - Razorpay Integration Complete

## 🎉 Integration Summary

The Natanam Event registration system has been successfully updated with Razorpay payment integration, replacing the screenshot upload functionality.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Frontend Changes

1. **Removed Screenshot Upload** - No more manual screenshot uploads
2. **Added Razorpay Payment** - Secure payment processing with Razorpay
3. **Real-time Status Checking** - Waits for webhook confirmation after payment
4. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Better error messages and retry options
5. **Payment Status Tracking** - Tracks payment from initiation to confirmation

### New Flow

```
Performance Type → Registration Form → Time Slots → Payment Summary → Razorpay Payment → Status Checking → Success/Failure
```

### Backend Changes

1. **Firebase Functions** - Webhook handlers for payment events
2. **Database Updates** - Enhanced booking schema with payment data
3. **Slot Management** - Automatic slot release on payment failure
4. **Webhook Security** - Signature verification for security

## 🔧 Components Created

### Frontend Components

- `RazorpayPayment.tsx` - Handles payment processing
- `PaymentSuccess.tsx` - Shows successful booking confirmation
- `PaymentFailure.tsx` - Shows payment failure with retry option
- `PaymentStatusChecker.tsx` - Real-time webhook status checking

### Backend Functions

- `razorpayWebhook` - Handles payment.captured and payment.failed events
- `webhookStatus` - Health check endpoint for webhook

## 📋 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Get Your Razorpay Keys

1. Create Razorpay account at https://razorpay.com
2. Get Test/Live Key ID and Secret from Dashboard
3. Save Key ID for environment variables

### 2. Deploy Firebase Functions

```bash
cd /Users/deepakbharadwaj/Documents/natanam-event
firebase login
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 3. Configure Webhook in Razorpay

1. Copy function URL from deployment output
2. Add webhook in Razorpay Dashboard:
   - URL: `https://your-project.cloudfunctions.net/razorpayWebhook`
   - Events: `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create `.env` file:

```bash
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_here
```

### 5. Test Payment Flow

1. Use Razorpay test cards for testing
2. Verify webhook receives events in Razorpay Dashboard
3. Check Firebase Functions logs for webhook processing

## 🔄 How It Works

### Payment Success Flow

1. User completes payment in Razorpay popup
2. Booking created with 'pending' status
3. Frontend shows "Processing Payment..." screen
4. Razorpay sends webhook to Firebase Function
5. Function updates booking to 'confirmed' status
6. Frontend detects status change and shows success

### Payment Failure Flow

1. Payment fails in Razorpay
2. Razorpay sends failure webhook to Firebase Function
3. Function cancels booking and releases time slots
4. Frontend shows failure screen with retry option

### Real-time Status Updates

- Frontend listens to Firestore changes in real-time
- 30-second timeout for webhook processing
- Fallback polling every 3 seconds
- Graceful handling of webhook delays

## 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Webhook Signature Verification** - Prevents fake webhook calls
2. **Payment ID Matching** - Links payments to specific bookings
3. **Slot Release on Failure** - Prevents slot blocking on failed payments
4. **Error Logging** - Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 📊 Database Schema

### Booking Object

```typescript
{
  id: string,
  date: string,
  timeSlots: string[],
  performanceType: string,
  participantDetails: object,
  paymentData: {
    paymentId: string,
    amount: number,
    currency: string,
    status: 'success' | 'failed' | 'pending',
    webhookProcessed: boolean
  },
  bookingStatus: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled',
  timestamp: serverTimestamp
}
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Automated Payment Processing** - No manual verification needed
2. **Real-time Confirmation** - Instant booking confirmation
3. **Better User Experience** - Clear status updates and error handling
4. **Secure Transactions** - Industry-standard security with Razorpay
5. **Automatic Slot Management** - No manual intervention for failed payments
